        "\n",
        "   - Analyzed the dataset for sstructure understanding, features, and distributions.\n",
        "   - Visualized key patterns, such as user preferences and movie popularity, to gain insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Content Based Filtering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Implemented a content-based recommender system using movie genres.\n",

        "   - Implemented a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model using SciKit Learn's KNN.\n",
        "   - Explored both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches.\n",
        "   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Based Collaborative Filtering (SVD):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Implemented a model-based collaborative filtering approach using the Surprise library and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n",
        "   - Evaluated the model's performance and explored hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Hybrid Approach:**\n",
        "   - Recommended a hybrid model that combines the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.\n",
        "   - Highlighted the potential benefits of leveraging both user-item interactions and content features.\n"
